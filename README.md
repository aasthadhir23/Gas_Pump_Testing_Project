# Gas_Pump_Testing_Project
Gas Pump Project is  an indivisual project done by me to understand how software testing is done. The goal of this project is to test the GasPump class that exhibits state behavior specified by the EFSM model. 
I have a test suite checker in which I can test the validity of my code and how it works when I test it using different test cases.
