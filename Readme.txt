I have created a TS.txt file that contains all the test cases
2. I have included steps to execute a code in document and as comments in code.
3. Green color bar in the report is Failed testcases.
4. test.jar is not working. I hope you can execute the code easily.




/*-------------------------------------
Steps to Execute the code
------------------------------------

Step-1 Keep both the GasPump.java and Testdriver.java the same folder named SoftTestProj. I have also kept testchecker.exe in the same folder.
 
Because this will acts as a package for my code.
 
Step 2- execute Testdriver.java. I have coded the Testdriver for the purpose of user friendly.It is compiled by using command javac TestDriver.java and 
its executed by running command java Testdriver
 
So, once you run the code it will ask your input.
 
Step -3 Now I have also uploaded TS.txt and it contains the list of all the test cases I used in the project.
 
All my code execution follows the same behaviour.
